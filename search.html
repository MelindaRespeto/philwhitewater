                    <p>Sea Kayaking 
                        Caramoan in the Bicol Region provides a totally untouched environment for kayakers who are willing to explore its pristine waters. This area is not usually frequented by tourists as there are no hotels or restaurants. However if you are looking for an outer-edge ocean experience,and prefer the unbeaten path,you will find it here. Plan your visit to Caramoan between the months of December and June.
                        
                        While other countries offer only three to five different seascapes, the Philippines can provide almost every kind of seascape that a person can imagine. You may move unobtrusively through crystal clear waters, or explore mangrove swamps, or cut across beaches. You will pass by exotic villages, sail above coral reefs and fish feeding grounds, and even find shelter in sea caves. And if you are looking for something more exciting, that is rough-water kayaking, you may go to any island facing the rugged eastern coast. This is the main reason why international tourists choose the Philippines as their destination: to have one fine rough-sea kayaking experience.
                        
                        For the tourist who wants to get away to a peaceful and practically untouched environment, Caramoan is a great place to explore. If you plan to do some kayaking, you must bring your own kayak and other safety gears (helmets and life vests). The locals have not yet put up kayaks for rent or similar other businesses.
                        You may find it convenient to bring the inflatable kayaks, but these are just safe for rivers, lakes, and calm sea waters. Since Caramoan faces the Pacific, the waters tend to be more aggressive. The Plexiglas types of kayaks are infinitely safer. It is best that you use those models that flip up each time they flip under.

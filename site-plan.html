        There are numerous activities in Caramoan Island that you can must immerse yourself in to get the best trip ever. It’s rare that you find a nice hiding place from the busy city life, so why enjoy it to the fullest?
Island Hopping
One of the best islands to go to is Matukad and Lahuy Islands where you can enjoy the beauty of Gota Beach and jump off in its limestone rock formations for a dip in the waters.
Caving
There are many caves in Caramoan Islands like the Omang Cave, Manipis Cave, and Culapnit Cave where you can see many ancient structure, stalactite and limestone formations, and even the rumored hiding spot of Yamashita’s Treasure.
Rock Climbing
There are also several sharp rocks you might wanna try climbing in Caramoan Island. One good example is Matukad Island’s striking sharp rocks that often challenge intermediate rock climbers. The view is definitely worth it as you can bask in the beauty of nature and the clear blue waters.

        Sea Kayaking 
Caramoan in the Bicol Region provides a totally untouched environment for kayakers who are willing to explore its pristine waters. This area is not usually frequented by tourists as there are no hotels or restaurants. However if you are looking for an outer-edge ocean experience,and prefer the unbeaten path,you will find it here. Plan your visit to Caramoan between the months of December and June.

While other countries offer only three to five different seascapes, the Philippines can provide almost every kind of seascape that a person can imagine. You may move unobtrusively through crystal clear waters, or explore mangrove swamps, or cut across beaches. You will pass by exotic villages, sail above coral reefs and fish feeding grounds, and even find shelter in sea caves. And if you are looking for something more exciting, that is rough-water kayaking, you may go to any island facing the rugged eastern coast. This is the main reason why international tourists choose the Philippines as their destination: to have one fine rough-sea kayaking experience.

For the tourist who wants to get away to a peaceful and practically untouched environment, Caramoan is a great place to explore. If you plan to do some kayaking, you must bring your own kayak and other safety gears (helmets and life vests). The locals have not yet put up kayaks for rent or similar other businesses.
You may find it convenient to bring the inflatable kayaks, but these are just safe for rivers, lakes, and calm sea waters. Since Caramoan faces the Pacific, the waters tend to be more aggressive. The Plexiglas types of kayaks are infinitely safer. It is best that you use those models that flip up each time they flip under.
